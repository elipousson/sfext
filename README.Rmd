The goal of sfext is to extend existing functions from the [{sf} package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and offer a range of additional options for working with simple feature objects, bounding boxes, and data frame objects with coordinates or other spatial information.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sfext like so:

``` r
# pak::pkg_install("elipousson/sfext")
```

## Usage

```{r setup}
library(sfext)
```

### Extending existing {sf} functions

`{sfext}` is built around existing sf functions but designed to offer greater flexibility around both inputs and outputs. For example, `read_sf_ext()` is a wrapper for `sf::read_sf()` and offers a similar functionality:

```{r}
nc <- read_sf_ext(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"))
```

However, `read_sf_ext()` also supports URLs for Google Sheets, FeatureLayers, data included with an installed package, and a variety of other sources. The function also supports an optional bounding box filter.


```{r}
read_sf_ext("https://carto.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/govunits/MapServer/29", bbox = as_bbox(nc))
```

`st_union_ext()` is nearly identical to `sf::st_union()` but optionally preserve a name column (collapsing the values of that column into a single string): 

```{r}
random_id <- sample(nrow(nc), size = 8)

nc_union <- st_union_ext(nc[random_id, ], name_col = "NAME")

plot(
  nc_union
)
```

`st_buffer_ext()` wraps `sf::st_buffer()` but accepts bounding box objects as an input, allows you to set the units for the buffer distance using a character string (automatically converts the buffer distance units to match the units of the input object):

```{r}
# Apply a 20 mile buffer to the unioned geometry
plot(
  st_buffer_ext(nc_union, dist = 20, unit = "mi")
)
```

`st_make_grid_ext()` wraps `sf::st_make_grid()` but makes it easy to set the dimensions of the grid using rows, columns, and an overall aspect ratio:

```{r}
# Make a 5 by 5 grid with a 8.5 by 11 aspect ratio filtered to x
plot(
  st_make_grid_ext(
    x = nc,
    asp = 11 / 8.5,
    ncol = 5,
    nrow = 5,
    filter = TRUE
  )
)
```

Most functions that include a `crs` parameter can convert the coordinate reference system of the output (using `transform_sf()` or `sf_bbox_transform()`). The crs parameter also supports sf, sfc, or bbox inputs. Functions that include a `class` parameter can convert the class of an object using `as_sf_class()`. There are a set of functions for class conversion that typically wrap multiple sf functions with more limited input options.

```{r}
nc_bbox <- as_bbox(nc, crs = 4326)

nc_bbox

as_sfc(nc[1, ], crs = 3857)

as_sf(nc_bbox, crs = nc)
```
Please note this flexibility make `{sfext}` easy to use (especially in an interactive context) but likely *not* appropriate for reproducible research. The package is being actively developed and the API may change.

### Additional helper functions for `sf` objects

sfext also includes several helper functions that add new features by combining functions from the {sf} package, using [affine geometry](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf3.html#affine-transformations), or adding features from other packages.

For example, `st_edge()` combines `sf::st_buffer()` and `sf::st_difference()` to get the "edges" of any geometry.

```{r}
plot(
  st_edge(nc, dist = 10, unit = "mi"),
  max.plot = 1
)
```

`st_nudge()` allows you to shift the position of an `sf` object to a new location:

```{r}
nc_nudge <- st_nudge(nc, to = nc[1, ])

plot(
  st_union_ext(
    nc,
    nc_nudge
  ),
  max.plot = 1
)
```

`st_donut()` allows you to create donuts around existing features:

```{r}
plot(
  st_donut(nc[c(1, 2, 3), ])
)
```

Lastly, the package has a whole group of helper functions for bbox objects. For example, `sf_bbox_corners()` creates a sf object with POINT geometry based on the corners of a bounding box:

```{r}
plot(
  sf_bbox_corners(
    as_bbox(nc)
  )
)
```

`{sfext}` *depends* on two other development packages:

- [{papersize}](https://elipousson.github.io/papersize/): A collection of convenience functions extending grid, ggplot2, and patchwork to help in sizing plots and files for printing to paper, postcards, playing cards, and other physical media.
- [{filenamr}](https://elipousson.github.io/filenamr/): A package to help create and modify file names and paths (that also supports reading and writing EXIF metadata).

It is also *used* extensively by two other development packages:
