\title{Get bounding box corner points from a bbox, sfc, or sf object}
\usage{
sf_bbox_corners(x, .id = "corner", class = "sf")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{bbox}, length 1 \code{sfc} object, or a \code{sf} object with a single
feature}

\item{.id}{A name to use for added column with cardinal position of points,
Default: 'corner'}

\item{class}{Class of object to return. Must be "sf" (default) or "sfc".}
}
\value{
A \code{sf} with four features (duplicating input feature with new
geometry derived from bounding box) or a length 4 \code{sfc} object with POINT
geometry.
}
\description{
If x is an sf object, the results include a column with a name matching .id
containing the values "SW", "SE", "NE", and "NW" corresponding to the
cardinal position of each corner.
}
