value}
\usage{
compare_dist(
  dist,
  x,
  units = NULL,
  to = "xdist",
  how = "ratio",
  tolerance = 1.5e-08,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist}{Distance to check as a units class or numeric vector}

\item{x}{A \code{sf}, \code{sfc}, or \code{bbox} object or a numeric vector.}

\item{units}{Units to compare. If dist or x are numeric they are assumed to
be in the provided units or the units of the coordinate reference system
(CRS) for x (if x is a \code{sf}, \code{sfc}, or \code{bbox} object).}

\item{to}{Distance to compare dist with. Standard options include "xdist"
(default), "ydist", or "diagdist" to compare to \code{\link[=sf_bbox_xdist]{sf_bbox_xdist()}},
\code{\link[=sf_bbox_ydist]{sf_bbox_ydist()}}, or \code{\link[=sf_bbox_diagdist]{sf_bbox_diagdist()}}. If to is a length 2 character
vector, x, to, and any ... parameters are passed to \code{\link[=sf_bbox_dist]{sf_bbox_dist()}}. If to is
an sf or sfc object, to and any additional ... parameters are passed to
\code{\link[sf:geos_measures]{sf::st_distance()}} using x as the first argument and to as the second. If
x is a numeric vector the value of to is ignored.}

\item{how}{If "ratio", dist divided by the comparison distance. If what is
"fit", return the number of times dist fits in the comparison distance
without remainder. If "longer", "shorter", "same", return a logical vector.}

\item{tolerance}{passed to \code{\link[=all.equal]{all.equal()}} if \code{how = "same"}}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{\link[sf:geos_measures]{sf::st_distance()}} if to is an sf
or sfc object or \code{\link[=sf_bbox_dist]{sf_bbox_dist()}} if to is a length 2 character vector.}
}
\value{
A logical or numeric vector.
}
\description{
Compare dist to a distance based on x. If to is "xdist" (default), "ydist",
"diagdist", or any length 2 character vector supported by \code{\link[=sf_bbox_dist]{sf_bbox_dist()}}
dist is compared to the resulting distance. If to is an sf or sfc object, the
comparison distance is the results from \code{\link[sf:geos_measures]{sf::st_distance()}} with x as the
first parameter and to as the second. x can also be a numeric value with or
without a units class. Use the "how" argument to determine the type of
comparison: "ratio" (dist divided by comparison distance) "fit" (how many
lengths of dist can fit wholly within the comparison distance) "longer",
"shorter", "same" (uses tolerance parameter).
